# Potato Front End Task

## Approach

- Angular2 (ng2) using Typescript 1.8
- Favoured Webpack/CommonJS over BrowserSync/SystemJS
- Dates formatted using MomentJS
- SASS Framework: Skeleton responsive
- ng2 structure:
    - Service for Flickr integration
    - JSONP XHR for API call
    - Pipes for transformations

## Improvements/Considerations

- Payload size / network performance issues to be solved
- Add unit/e2e tests

## Issues faced

- Unit testing on ng2 was extremely problematic
